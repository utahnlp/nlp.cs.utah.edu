Many NLP tasks are naturally structured: that is, their outputs consist of multiple labels which constrain each other. Annotating data for such tasks can be cumbersome. Can the promise of the prompt-based paradigm be extended to such structured outputs? In this paper, we present a framework for constructing zero- and few-shot linguistic structure predictors. Our key insight is that we can use structural constraints{---}and combinatorial inference derived from them{---}to filter out inconsistent structures predicted by large language models. We instantiated this framework on two structured prediction tasks, and five datasets. Across all cases, our results show that enforcing consistency not only constructs structurally valid outputs, but also improves performance over the unconstrained variants.",

However, a number of problems persist in ICL. In particular, its performance is sensitive to the choice and order of in-context examples. Given the same set of in-context examples with different orderings, model performance may vary from near random to near state-of-the-art. In this work, we formulate in-context example ordering as an optimization problem. We examine three problem settings that differ in the assumptions they make about what is known about the task. Inspired by the idea of learning from label proportions, we propose two principles for in-context example ordering guided by model{'}s probability predictions. We apply our proposed principles to thirteen text classification datasets and nine different autoregressive LLMs with 700M to 13B parameters. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baselines by improving the classification accuracy, reducing model miscalibration, and also by selecting better in-context examples.",

More human-centered, application-grounded evaluations of explanations are needed to settle this. Yet, with no established guidelines for such studies in NLP, researchers accustomed to standardized proxy evaluations must discover appropriate measurements, tasks, datasets, and sensible models for human-AI teams in their studies. To aid with this, we first review existing metrics suitable for application-grounded evaluation. We then establish criteria to select appropriate datasets, and using them, we find that only 4 out of over 50 datasets available for explainability research in NLP meet them. We then demonstrate the importance of reassessing the state of the art to form and study human-AI teams: teaming people with models for certain tasks might only now start to make sense, and for others, it remains unsound. Finally, we present the exemplar studies of human-AI decision-making for one of the identified tasks {---} verifying the correctness of a legal claim given a contract. Our results show that providing AI predictions, with or without explanations, does not cause decision makers to speed up their work without compromising performance. We argue for revisiting the setup of human-AI teams and improving automatic deferral of instances to AI, where explanations could play a useful role."

As a result of this momentum towards local deployment, compressed LLMs will interact with a large population. Prior work on compression typically prioritize preserving perplexity, which is directly analogous to training loss. The impact of compression method on other critical aspects of model behavior{---}particularly safety{---}requires systematic assessment. To this end, we investigate the impact of model compression along four dimensions: (1) degeneration harm, i.e., bias and toxicity in generation; (2) representational harm, i.e., biases in discriminative tasks; (3) dialect bias; and (4) language modeling and downstream task performance. We examine a wide spectrum of LLM compression techniques, including unstructured pruning, semi-structured pruning, and quantization. Our analysis reveals that compression can lead to unexpected consequences. Although compression may unintentionally alleviate LLMs' degeneration harm, it can still exacerbate representational harm. Furthermore, increasing compression produces a divergent impact on different protected groups. Finally, different compression methods have drastically different safety impacts: for example, quantization mostly preserves bias while pruning degrades quickly. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating safety assessments into the development of compressed LLMs to ensure their reliability across real-world applications."

Our analysis reveals that not all out-of-domain tests provide insight into robustness. Evaluating with CheckLists and contrast sets shows significant gaps in model performance; merely scaling models does not make them adequately robust. Finally, we point out that current approaches for adversarial evaluations of models are themselves problematic: they can be easily thwarted, and in their current forms, do not represent a sufficiently deep probe of model robustness. We conclude that not only is the question of robustness in NLP as yet unresolved, but even some of the approaches to measure robustness need to be reassessed.",

Prior efforts to measure conversational empathy mostly focus on expressed communicative intents{---}that is, the way empathy is expressed. Yet, these works ignore the fact that conversation is also a collaboration involving both speakers and listeners. In contrast, we propose a multi-dimensional empathy evaluation framework to measure both expressed intents from the speaker`s perspective and perceived empathy from the listener`s perspective. We apply our analytical framework to examine internal customer-service dialogues. We find the two dimensions (expressed intent types and perceived empathy) are interconnected, while perceived empathy has high correlations with dialogue satisfaction levels.To reduce the annotation cost, we explore different options to automatically measure conversational empathy: prompting LLMs and training language model-based classifiers. Our experiments show that prompting methods with even popular models like GPT-4 and Flan family models perform relatively poorly on both public and our internal datasets. In contrast, instruction-finetuned classifiers based on FlanT5 family models outperform prior works and competitive baselines. We conduct a detailed ablation study to give more insights into instruction finetuning method`s strong performance."

abstract = {Search Result Explanation (SeRE) aims to improve search sessions' effectiveness and efficiency by helping users interpret documents' relevance. Existing works mostly focus on factual explanation, i.e. to find/generate supporting evidence about documents' relevance to search queries. However, research in cognitive sciences has shown that human explanations are contrastive i.e. people explain an observed event using some counterfactual events; such explanations reduce cognitive load and provide actionable insights. Though already proven effective in machine learning and NLP communities, there lacks a strict formulation on how counterfactual explanations should be defined and structured, in the context of web search. In this paper, we first discuss the possible formulation of counterfactual explanations in the IR context. Next, we formulate a suite of desiderata for counterfactual explanation in SeRE task and corresponding automatic metrics. With this desiderata, we propose a method named CounterFactual Editing for Search Research Explanation (CFE2). CFE2 provides pairwise counterfactual explanations for document pairs within a search engine result page. Our experiments on five public search datasets demonstrate that CFE2can significantly outperform baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) are susceptible to Interaction-level Membership Inference Attacks (IMIAs), which aim to determine whether specific user-item interactions are present in the training data of the target RS. However, existing IMIAs struggle with inferring the membership of tail interactions, i.e., the interactions involving tail items, due to the limited information available about these items. This paper introduces MINER, a new IMIA designed to enhance attack performance against RSs with long-tailed item distribution. MINER addresses the information scarcity of tail items at both the feature and sample levels. At the feature level, MINER leverages the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to obtain the auxiliary knowledge of tail items. At the sample level, MINER designs a Bilateral-Branch Network (BBN) as the attack model. The BBN trains two branches independently, with one branch trained on interaction samples with the original long-tailed item distribution and the other on interaction samples with a more balanced item distribution. The outputs of the two branches are aggregated using a cumulative learning component. Our experimental results demonstrate that MINER significantly enhances the attack accuracy of IMIA, especially for tail interactions. Beyond attack design, we design a defense mechanism named RGL to defend against MINER. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that RGL effectively mitigates the privacy risks posed by MINER while preserving recommendation accuracy.

Therefore, in this work, we addresses the limitation of current VisualQA models when applied to charts and plots. To investigate shortcomings of the state-of-the-art models, we conduct a comprehensive behavioral analysis, using ChartQA as a case study. Our findings indicate that existing models particularly underperform in answering questions related to the chart`s structural and visual context, as well as numerical information. To address these issues, we propose three simple pre-training tasks that enforce the existing model in terms of both structural-visual knowledge, as well as its understanding of numerical questions. We evaluate our pre-trained model (called MatCha-v2) on three chart datasets - both extractive and abstractive question datasets - and observe that it achieves an average improvement of 1.7 {\%} over the baseline model."

Their critical role in real-time system monitoring and behavior analysis cannot be overstated, making them invaluable tools for system administrators and developers alike. Automated parsing of log messages—turning the text of log messages into parsed, structured data—is a significant research area. Despite the number of log parsers that have emerged over the years, there has been a noticeable gap in the evaluation of these tools, reproduction of results, and direct comparisons between them on a level playing field. Recognizing this, we re-implemented twelve of the most popular log parsers from scratch, enabling them to be used in replication studies. This paper presents our open-source project LogFlux, which is a suite for evaluating automated log parsers so that studies involving them can be replicated. Through LogFlux, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical log parsing methods and their practical application, offering a robust and easy to use solution that is accessible and effective for a range of users. Our experience in attempting to obtain results from many published log parser algorithms has shed light on important aspects of replication, such as the value of independent implementation for uncovering bugs and the need for careful software engineering to facilitate maintenance.},
