about: A unified frame-evoking conceptual alignment formalism supporting both concept and relation alignment by AMR reification. What's more, it shows conceptual-only alignment is enough to represent the relation alignment in ISI without dropping any unalignable relations. Then we can compare JAMR and ISI alignment more closely.
